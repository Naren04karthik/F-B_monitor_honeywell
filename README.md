# 🍞🥛 F&B Vision: Smart Anomaly Prediction Framework for Food Process Quality Control
## 📌 Overview

This project, developed for the Honeywell Hackathon, introduces F&B Vision, a real-time anomaly detection and quality monitoring system for the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry.

It combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and LightGBM classifiers to detect process deviations in food production lines (bread, cake, cheese, milk, wine). The system is deployed as an interactive web dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, enabling operators and engineers to track, analyze, and prevent quality issues.

## 🚀 Features

Live Process Monitoring – Real-time tracking of process parameters (temperature, pH, mixer speed, etc.)

Batch Data Analysis – Upload CSV datasets, validate, and visualize batch summaries

Anomaly Detection – Detect anomalies at both batch and single-sample levels with configurable thresholds

Trend Analytics – KPI monitoring, batch explorer, deviation, and Pareto analysis

User-Friendly Dashboard – Styled Streamlit interface with alerts, parameter cards, and export options

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Frameworks: Streamlit, PyTorch, LightGBM

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib (optional)
